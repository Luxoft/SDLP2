* Introduction
  ================
  smartDeviceLinkCore is an application which manages the transport, connection and communication between a head unit and mobile device.

* OS and Hardware
  =========
  Ubuntu 12.04.01 LTS 32-bit OS on the PC with USB-dongle
  Application has been tested using 2 types of USB-dongle:
  D-Link DBT-122
  STLab B-121mini

* External components
  ===================
  Run the setup_env.sh script
  Download and install log4cplus: http://sourceforge.net/p/log4cplus/wiki/Home/
  Download and install zeromq: http://zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software (the 3.x.x. version)
 
* Build application
  =================
  We support "out of sources" concept for build from R3.0.0
  It means all generated by build tools files will be stored in separate folder.
  Temporary build of application requires two steps.
  1. Enter src/thirdPartyLibs/logger
  build logger:

  1. Create directory outside of SmartDeviceLink project directory.
  For example "build" folder in the same folder with SmartDeviceLink git repo folder which has a name "git_repo":
  You will have folders structure like this:
  /home/projects/smart_device_link
  |--build
  |--git_repo
     |-- SDL_Core
     	|--doc
     	|--src
     	|--test
     	|--DoxyFile
     	\--CMakeLists.txt
  Enter this folder:
  cd build

  2. Create build configuration using cmake:
  2.1 For Debug configuration
  cmake ../git_repo/SDL_Core
  2.2 For Release configuration, run:
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../git_repo/SDL_Core
  2.3 For Debug configuration with tests, run:
  cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=On ../git_repo/SDL_Core

  3. Make project:
  make

  Ready to use release application will be in build/src/appMain/smartDeviceLinkCore

  4. If You built configuration with tests (see 2.3 above), then You can run all project tests and see overall result with:
  make test

  5. For creating the doxygen documentation run:
  make doxygen
